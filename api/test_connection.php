**This checks if you're ONLINE or OFFLINE!**
Without it, status will always show OFFLINE.

### **4. search_products.php** ⚙️ **Optional but recommended**
- Used for manual search feature
- Not critical but good to have

### **5. get_all_products.php** ⚙️ **Optional**
- For getting all products at once
- Nice to have but not essential
